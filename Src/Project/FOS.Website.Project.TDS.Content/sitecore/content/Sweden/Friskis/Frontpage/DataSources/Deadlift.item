<h3 class="dpg-h3" style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 0.7rem;">WHY DEADLIFT?</h3>
<p style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-left: 0px;">It's always important to start with why. Why? Because having a good reason for doing something makes planning easier.</p>
<p style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-left: 0px;">So, why deadlift? Quite simply, the deadlift is one of the most effective exercises for developing the pure strength that's a precursor to bodily size and athleticism. Since it's a full-body exercise that recruits a lot of muscle mass, the deadlift also builds total-body muscle.<span>1</span>&nbsp;It's also one of the few exercises that directly targets the hamstrings, a group of muscles often neglected in the weight room.<span>2</span></p>
<p style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-left: 0px;">The deadlift also improves posture. We live most of our lives in front of our bodies, ignoring our rears. In turn, we develop bodily frames without balance, leading to a host of postural issues&mdash;hunched shoulders and weak backs, for example. Deadlifting reintroduces us to our body's backside. Posterior training balances the body, giving us cause to stand taller and with greater strength.</p>
<p style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-left: 0px;">In short, deadlifting will support your aesthetic goals, help you build better posture, correct various strength imbalances, help you build total strength, and turn you into a total gym badass. After all, there's nothing quite like ripping heavy weight from the ground.</p>
<p style="color: #232323; background-color: #ffffff; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-left: 0px;">Now, you're probably eager to practice deadlifting in the gym, but hang on a moment. I often work with lifters who want to rocket headfirst into a movement, when in reality it's important to pump the breaks and master the basics first.</p>
